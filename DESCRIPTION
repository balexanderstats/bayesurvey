Description: This package implements Bayesian conjugate prior models with a focus on handling survey data with multiple categories. 
It starts by normalizing and transforming the data,  then fits prior distributions, and runs a conjugate prior analysis that can be iterative. 
While many of the functions are designed for categorical data, the conjugate prior functions work with any type of data.
